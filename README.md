# Oikos Twitter Widget

This is code for a simple WordPress Twitter widget that uses oAuth, Twitter API v1.1 and that attempts to meet the display guidelines.

This has been put together hastily from my notes at http://oikos.org.uk/2013/02/tech-notes-displaying-twitter-statuses-using-api-v1-1-and-oath/

This is also my first go at doing anything with oAuth. Consider it early alpha software, and feel free to comment or contribute.

Todo list:

* Make options page for oAuth credentials (and find out how to secure them properly)
* Allow custom CSS
